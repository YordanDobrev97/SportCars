This is a small and simple project, entirely based on pure HTML & CSS with a responsive design. The project is created to demonstrate my skills in managing web technologies and creating responsive interfaces.

***Features***  
The project offers a minimalist yet functional website, developed entirely with HTML & CSS.
The design is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to various screen sizes, including mobile devices, tablets, and desktop computers.
No external libraries or frameworks are used. All styles and layouts are hand-coded, showcasing my proficiency in clean HTML & CSS code.
